    #LOC_TWB_Wall.Creeper.description = For some reason this dwarf planet gives us a feeling that it is going to explode at any moment. Therefore, we have decided to make sure no attempt to detonate this planet will be made, especially Jeb's proposal to build the largest Orion drive possible using Creeper.

	  #LOC_TWB_Wall.Nyarlathotep.description = Originally thought as a dense carbon planet with a solid diamond core, scientists now realise that Nyarlathotep is almost completely composed by exotic elements not found on Kerbin. They estimate that as more elements are identified, some "really annoying changes that will screw up everything" are coming to the periodic table.
