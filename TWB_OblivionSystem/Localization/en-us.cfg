    // Kaamo
    #LOC_TWB_Oblivion.Kaamo.name = Kaamo
	  #LOC_TWB_Oblivion.Kaamo.description = A large planet with the density of a moon, the most interesting thing Kaamo has to offer is its view of a ring from a ring. In addition, it harbor a very large amount of asteroids, meaning that it is highly possible Kaamo will take the title of "Kind of Asteroids" from Dres, making the later even less worth visiting. Actually, that explained why the Kerbol Combined Excavation Association sent us so many contracts so ship bore drills and mining lasers...

    // Kroadwell
    #LOC_TWB_Oblivion.Kroadwell.name = Kroadwell
	  #LOC_TWB_Oblivion.Kroadwell.description = Kroadwell is a rather new gas giant is still cooling down, and it's high temperature and pressure may allow it to rain heavy and flammable diamonds deep inside its atmosphere during this period. Strangely, Jeb isn't interested in flying into it's atmosphere becuase "it doesn't rain snacks".

    #LOC_TWB_Oblivion.Kroadwell.Nirvana.name = Nirvana
    #LOC_TWB_Oblivion.Kroadwell.Nirvana.description = Inspection of the ice composition of Nirvana revealed that it is mostly water, which means that if the orbit of Kroadwell become closer to Oblivion, causing Nirvana to heat up, it could potentially support life one day. Therefore, all attempts of scooping the ice to replenish water supply must be done in extreme caution.
