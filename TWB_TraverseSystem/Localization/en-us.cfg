    #LOC_TWB_Traverse.Adeon.description = "There is a place in the distance... a place that I've been dreaming of..." was the last decode-able message we got while tracing a unknown signal allegedly on the surface on Adeon. Whether that's a prank or not, that description actually fits Adeon surprisingly well, considering this is probably the most habitable desert planet found so far. Also, the R&D insists that "habitable desert planet" is not a oxymoron.

But in reality, Seraph is actually very easy to approach and bounce on, as long as you don't accidently jump into a lava crack. Some pioneering technology companies are already planning to set up "magma resorts" there, whatever that means.

Amaterasu is the center of an inexplicable entanglement of power between Overture and itself, with a seemingly boundless ambient power casted on it's field.

Once upon a time, Jeanne was a temperate world like Brynhildr, but it was corrupted into a forsaken wasteland like Eve. But it refused. Eventually, Jeanne restored into a diverse and thriving world, golden plains of corps under the azure, creating a brilliant field of view. Maybe miracles are real after all.

A much more shocking discovery is made recently, as Bishamonten's fossil records show that life there origined only 50 thousand years ago and since undergone rapid growth and evolution.
