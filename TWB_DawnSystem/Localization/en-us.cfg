	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Border.description = Border is what we like to call a Ultimate Super Ultra Legendary Mysterious Very Long Period Super Comet EXTREME EDITION Pro X SSR®™, or a very eccentric comet for short. While we can save a colossal amount of fuel by putting ships onto Border and wait for it to enter the inner Dawn system, this plan has been repeatly called "slow" and "boring" by even Kerbals other than Jeb.

	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Gersemi.description = The first world in the habitable zone, Gersemi is still a bit too close to the Dawn, but hey, it's got an oxygen atmosphere and liquid water oases, which could be a sutibe location for kerbinforming when the techology matures. Val is not a fan of deserts, but she is still going there tanning.

What is interesting is that this hunk of rock is the origin of a pulse signal "ADVANT" that is believed to be artificial.

It may look stormy from the space high above, but the gentle breeze in the upper atmosphere is quite nice for high autitude picnics.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Hikari.Basin.description = Basin's got a unpropotionally high atmosphere for it's size, which is also pretty stormy for that pressure. However, if one were to get pass it's intense higher atmpsphere, the condition on the sea level is much more appreciable.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Hikari.Ebott.description = After seeing a mythical mountain in a contained blackhole seconds before it collaspes and blew up half of the R&D, Wernher insisted to name this mountainous world Ebott. Maybe another secret passage to another world lies here... OK, seriously, what's with so many worlds here allegedly having portals to parallel universes? I know this planet pack is called The World Beyond but still... Also what do you mean "the fourth wall has already been destroyed"? Can't we speak in something less ambigious and artistic?

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Hikari.Moun.description = Not to be confused with a spherical starship with an "Infinite Improbability Drive", Moun is just one of those tiny natural satelite where a oversized trampoline is enough to get you into orbit.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Hikari.Sandalphon.description = A bright ocean world that maintains the order of Hikari's ring. Sandalphon is one of the few places near the Dawn where you can take off your helmets and feel like that you are crusing in the cosmos and leaving a trail of asteroids behind you. In reality though, the nearest part of the ring is a lot farther away so you don't need to be worried about a "asteroid swarm" raining on you.

While the high concentration of liquid water in its ocean indicates the life there might not be that different from our own, the plants there sure are going to taste grea- I mean yeild useful data.

	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Horu.description = Named after a fantastic volcano in a mystrious forest in one of Bill's dreams, Horu is best known for Wernher's Chekhov's Volcano theory, which states that "If a volcano is present, it's eruption is inevitable, since otherwise it will just be a regular mountain." On the other hand, we are planning to add visiting this planet onto the List of Things Jeb is not Allowed to Do (revision 2338f) until advances in material science allow us to build something that can reliably land in Horu's lava oceans.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Horu.Keter.description = It is believed that there used to be liquid water oceans on Keter... until it got too close to Horu... which got too close to the Dawn.

	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Hyperion.description = Previous low resolution grond telescope images suggest that "bands of moving molten cotton candy" floats in the atmosphere of this world, but it turns out, those are just disappointing glowing clouds caused by Hyperion being too close to the Dawn.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Infinity.name = Infinity
	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Infinity.description = While it's status of a planet is disputed as it qualifies more as a dwarf, Infinity had been theorized to be a giant ice cream ball of the greatest flavor that no one has tasted.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Kaze.Epik.description = This fragmented world is probably one of the more exciting and intense scientific discoveries around Dawn. For one thing, Epik is a bit cooler and a lot easier to access than Horu, and analyses show that their geology might not be that different. Plus, we are confident enough that our EVA suits won't catch fire at such temperatures! The warranty, however, is probably going to get voided.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Kaze.Ouroboros.description = Oh my! This thing came outta nowhere and just decided to sit in a polar retrograde orbit, which isn't exactly polite. But, Ouroboros's idiosyncratic behavior is, per usual, very found of the scientific community. For now, we will respect celestial bodies' orders and no attempt will be made to change it's orbit.

	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Paradise.description = Paradise is the second planet in the habitable zone and the holiest world in the Inner Dawn System, for it is the fire that reignited Kerbalkind's ambition for interstelar travel.

We also believe that Asgard have the best view of the sky in the entire Inner Dawn system, with multiple worlds and rings visible at almost all times.

Plus, with a Kerbin-like atmosphere pressure and lower gravity, it might actually be possible to bear some kind of dragon like lifeforms. Oddly, this world almost matches exactly to a land in Kerbal Mythology that is the home to the legendary dragon Bahamut, and this myth will be testified again when we are laying in the grass of Bahamut's red deserts, watching the endless sky.

Just when we think there can't possibly be another habitable world near Paradise, we found another one! Fantasy is now the most popular moon in the Paradise system according to 13 different public polls.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Paradise.Horizon.description = Horizon is the wise protector and overseer of the Paradise system and one of the more friendly rocky world that is open to any hikers. It's thin oxygen atmosphere also makes spaceplane trench run very possible, and the aviation community is looking for pilots to test fly some crafts on Horizon. Don't worry, we have omitted this and the previous sentence from Jeb's copy of the Dawn system database.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Paradise.Vindication.description = While not having as many edges as a chunk of Bismuth crystal [citation needed], Vindication certainly is as colorful as one, and it indeed contains a generous amount of rare and exotic elements, even a few not found on Kerbin. However, we do not support any attempt to bring it to Kerbin and crash the rare element market, both figuratively and literally.

	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Summit.description = It is only 2 minutes before our lander probe touched on Summit's surface did we realise it's atmosphere is actually thick enough to "not be ignored". This prompted an immediate promotion of the engineer who put "useless" parachutes on said probe. The Kerbinside Mountain Climbing Enthusiasts have been planning an expedition to reach it's highest point, but everyone knows they are just trying to claim the entire chocolate ball of Summit for themselves, which why we have to reach there before they do.

	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Tengu.description = Unfortunately, it turns out that this isn't a Dyson swarm, Object-TNG-01336 is actually something a lot more peculiar: a small planet! After giving it a more reasonable name, our scientists suggest that its retrograde orbit might help our future barbecue missions in "unpredictable" ways.

	#LOC_TWB_Dawn.Yama.description = We don't really know what they were thinking when the astronomers named it, but Yama has no mountains. If anything, Yama should be called Jool II: Electric Boogaloo. This ice giant houses the most violent storms in the entire Dawn system, which is actually a great show assuming you are watching it from afar. Hold on, did we already have "flying into Yama's atmosphere" into the List of Things Jeb is not Allowed to Do? Yes? Good.

    #LOC_TWB_Dawn.Yama.Hai.description = The idea of building a base inside a tiny world such as Hai was brought up again in the R&D, since it's nearly impossible to land a long term base of Leviathan and Hai will serve as a midpoint for any mission on Leviathan's surface. Oh well, who are we kidding, you are probably going to land some megastructures onto Leviathan and ignore this moon anyway.

Some say it is the wrath of the Kraken, some believe that invaluable treasures (read: snacks) hide within.

Speaking of endrance, we should totally pick up that Endurance replica and fly it to Xuanwu.
