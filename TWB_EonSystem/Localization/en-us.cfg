	// Everest
    #LOC_TWB_Eon.Everest.name = Everest
    #LOC_TWB_Eon.Everest.description = Everest is the home of at least 28 tallest points known to the Kerbalkind. Since then, this world have attracted a lot of inerest from the Mountain Documentation Society and the Aviation Association, for it's endless mountain ranges and the very tall but thin atmosphere. We've decided to not add "planting a flag on the tallest point of Everest" into the List of Things Jeb is not Allowed to Do, because that'd actually be pretty badass.

    // Kestrel
    #LOC_TWB_Eon.Kestrel.name = Kestrel
	#LOC_TWB_Eon.Kestrel.description = Kestrel is the confirmed largest water deposit known in the universe, with the majority of it's liquid mass between it's core and ice cap being 98% water. We have warned aganist every scientific community that Kestrel's water supply should NOT be used to test if any gas giant would float on water, since doing so "can accidently turn a gas giant into a brown dwarf".

    // Newell
    #LOC_TWB_Eon.Newell.name = Newell
    #LOC_TWB_Eon.Newell.description = Newell is the absolute largest a gas giant can get before its core starts to undergo fusion, and our scientists described it as being "worth the weight". But before all that, it was believed to be another protostar in the Dawn Cluster, but continued observations show that what surronds it is not a protoplanetary disk, but a immense ring system. This discovery immediately caused the Olympik Association to announce that hula looping will no longer be considered a sport.

    #LOC_TWB_Eon.Newell.Iris.name = Iris
	#LOC_TWB_Eon.Newell.Iris.description = Being the cause of a particularly large void in Newell's rings, Iris is currently the world furthest from it's host star's habitable zone. It is agreed that Newell's massive tidal force heated up this moon and allowed the presense of liquid water and life. We are actually pretty jelous that the life on Iris gets to have such an awesome view...

    // Wallnut
    #LOC_TWB_Eon.Wallnut.name = Wallnut
	#LOC_TWB_Eon.Wallnut.description = Wallnut is named after The Board Celestial Body Naming Task Force finally decided to allow naming things after edibles. Despite critics saying they obviously misspelled the word, they insist that a "wall-nut" is somthing Jeb mentioned from his distant memories. After carefully reading the Kuiness rules, we believe that this thing will qualify for the World's Biggest Nut record.
