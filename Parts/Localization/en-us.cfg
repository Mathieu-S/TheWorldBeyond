		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-1_Title = PN-C-T100 "Unbidden" Communication Array
		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-1_Manufacturer = Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. | MALIWAN | Jebediah Kerman's Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Co
		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-1_Description = This gigantic antenna array is the first solution ever created as a solution to really short ranged (relatively speaking) interstellar travel. And because it's so big we even had the space to pad the back of the transmitter with radiators! Too bad you probably can't spam this on your ship for extreme cooling though...

		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-2_Title = PN-CA-P1 "Over the Garden Wall" Communication Platform
		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-2_Manufacturer = Mann Co. | The Overwatch | Ratatoskr | Chaldea Security Organization
		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-2_Description = A somewhat more reasonable sized solution to interstellar travel of even longer distance, this communication Array makes high speed data transmission somewhat more efficient. Not to be used for 0G skateboarding stunts.
		
		//TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-X
		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-X_Title = PN-CA-PX "Beyond the Boundary" Communication Interface
		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-X_Manufacturer = SPECTRUM
		#LOC_TWB_Parts_TWB-VeryBigAntenna-25-X_Description = The result of ignoring the question "How are we supposed to put this into orbit", this is the (current) ultimate communication system. Thanks to the intregated positronic tachyon hyper-transmiters, it allows instantaneous data transmission no matter how far away you are from the reviever, and can sometimes deliver data before you send it.
