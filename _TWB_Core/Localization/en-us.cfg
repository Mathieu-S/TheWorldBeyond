	// Ascension System
    #LOC_TWB_Core.Ascension.name = Ascension
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Ascension.description = Known as "The Protector of the Dust", Ascension has been mentioned in multiple Kerbal mythologies, connecting with Traverse and forming The Overworld. Considering that without this M5V red dawrf shining a third light onto Traverse's worlds, the domain of Traverse might really only consists of some lifeless rocks in chaotic orbits. plus, we also get two MOAR worlds to colonize !

    #LOC_TWB_Core.Eternal.name = Eternal
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Eternal.description = It's likely that Eternal will not live up to it's name, but this M8V red dwarf will still glow for a few trillion years, silently recording the universe as dust grows into gold, and seas become fields. After all the journey, it rests within a close binary with Ascension, looking back into the deep azure where it was created. Eternal has witnessed the worlds come together and break apart, and one day in this universe, they will converge again.

	// Dawn System
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Dawn.name = Dawn
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Dawn.description = An A3V class bright blue star, Dawn is the core of a multi-star cluster full of exoplanets, a large number of which seems to be habitable. While the scientists have yet to figure out why there are so many smaller stars in this cluster instead of just a single supergiant, the entire Kerbalkind throughout histroy agree that it is the most majestic thing in the sky, that is, assuming it's bright light doesn't block anything even more interesting. You see, this is the why we have Alcubierre drives, not because Jeb wanted to come to work faster.

	// Eon System
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Eon.name = Eon
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Eon.description = While the amount of eons Eon have existed for is still a approximate number, and whether eon means a billion years or forever is still up to debate, the system of this G7V yellow dwarf seems rather forsaken. Of course, we are certain that there are definitely no "debris field left by an ancient battle between precursor civilizations" near it.

    #LOC_TWB_Core.Barrier.name = Barrier
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Barrier.description = Barrier has been compared to a lighthouse that guides into the Dawn System very often, except that it's spherical, extremely hot, incredibly dense and is spinning very, very fast. Initially thought as a neutron star, newer composition analysis show that it is compltely made of exotic matter. The most prevailing theory states that Barrier is the ejected remnant of a large exotic star that gave birth to the Dawn Cluster and created the nebula around Traverse. One the other hand, some still believe that The Ancient Legacy built this precursor star in order to create a heaven for the distant future...

	// Oblivion System
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Oblivion.name = Oblivion
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Oblivion.description = Either that the light of Dawn is really obscuring our views, or this pre-main-sequence object just formed last Thursday, or maybe we simply forgot about its existance for a while, which is probably why it's named Oblivion. Nevertheless, this young star guards the empty regions near the Dawn system. A few planetary objects have already formed around, combined with it's crispy looking protoplanetary debris disk making it a very tempting place to visit.

	// Traverse System
    #LOC_TWB_Core.Traverse.name = Traverse
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Traverse.description = A beacon quietly traversing through the vast ocean known as the universe. Traverse's posession of a immense and divine nebula, the abnormally high amout of friedly worlds and multiple "artificial" signals within it's realm put this quaternary system centered around this M1V orange dwarf anything but ordinary. Someday, Traverse will be the pathway to The World Beyond, where the Kerbalkind will touch all it's dreams; Someday, this system will be called The Place Where it All Began; Someday, all the boundaries will fall.

    #LOC_TWB_Core.Fragment.name = Fragment
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Fragment.description = Fragment is a precious everlasting M9V red dwarf that is still in it's cosmic inception. Like a seed, it carries the essence of a great ancient culture and will one day give it's knowledge back to the world. Prophecy says that Fragment is the key to The Incision, and the worlds around it are the guides to the Day of Convergence. The multiverse calls from the immense horizon above, and the answer lies within the vicinity of Traverse and Fragment. *Epic cinematic orchestra music is strongly advised while entering this system.*

	// Wall System
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Wall.name = Wall
	#LOC_TWB_Core.Wall.description = You see, one of the defining feature of the universe is that it is unfair and curel. Like this T4 class brown dwarf that failed to become a star for example ! The good thing is, we can shower it with love by sending probes and expeditions because brown dwarfs are actually pretty cool. Hehe... You see what I did there ? Pretty C-O-O-L right ? Get it ?
